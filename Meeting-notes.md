## Summary of works
We discussed the project plan everyone together. We discussed the game's structure, class/module design, and libraries that we will use. We wrote most of the project plan, but faced difficulties when it came to dividing the work. So far we have planned the scope of the project, main structure of the program, tasks for work division, initial schedule and a draft structure of the code with core directories.

## Challenges
1. Work division

## Actions
1. Continue the planning tomorrow

## Project status 
Most of the project plan done, work division and class diagrams etc. still needed.

### TODOs
1. Decide about the work divion
2. Implement diagrams of the project design, class structure etc.
